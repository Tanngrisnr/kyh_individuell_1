# KYH - Individual assignment 1 
This is my first indivudual project from KYH front-end development program at KYH Stockholm

The design and layout was inspired by graphic design from a specifiv VHS cassette and the site utlizes relative units and methods for size and positioning throughout. A live version can be found at https://tanngrisnr.github.io/kyh_individuell_1/ at time of writing this Readme. I could concieve of bringing this website further to become a portfolio or blog for myself as a designer due to how much I enjoyed the process of making it. The cite was coded in pure HTML, CSS and Javascript

# Design
The look of the website is based on the cover of an old blank cassette tape using colors collected from the image and adjusted to be aesthetically pleasing. the website's layout was also adjusted to have certain elements like the hamburger menu and text article element tilt. Apperance and animations are all governed by pure CSS.

# Javascript functionality
The Website uses Javascript to control localstorage where it sends a list of objects that are also rendered on the site on the contact page. When the form is filled in, submitted and validates it creates an object that gets pushed to an array that is in turn converted into JSON and sent to local storage.
