# kyh_individuell_1
This is my first indivudual project from KYH front-end development program at KYH Stockholm

The design and layout was inspired by graphic design from a specifiv VHS cassette and the site utlizes relative units and methods for size and positioning throughout.
A live version can be found at https://tanngrisnr.github.io/kyh_individuell_1/ at time of writing this Readme (21/10/2020) and I could concieve of bringing this website further to become a portfolio or blog for myself as a designer due to how much I enjoyed the process of making it.
